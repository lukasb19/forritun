#Design an algorithm that generates the first n numbers in the following sequence:
# ; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ___, ___, ___, â€¦
#The way the algorithm works is you add the current number with the last 2 numbers in the algorithm
#That way you get the next number

n = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: ")) # Do not change this line
