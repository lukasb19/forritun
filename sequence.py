#Design an algorithm that generates the first n numbers in the following sequence:
# ; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ___, ___, ___, â€¦
#The way the algorithm works is you add the current number with the last 2 numbers in the algorithm
#That way you get the next number

n = int(input("Enter the length of the sequence: ")) # Do not change this line
current_int = 3
previous_int = 2
last_int = 1
n -= 3             #withdraw 3 from n because I already set the first 3 numbers in the sequence

print(last_int, previous_int, current_int, end=" ")
for i in range(n):
    #I add last 2 ints to the current int, make that the current int
    #then i make the last int be previous int, and previous int be current int before it was changed
    current_int, previous_int, last_int = current_int + previous_int + last_int, current_int, previous_int
    print(current_int, end=" ")
